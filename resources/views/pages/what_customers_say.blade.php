            <h3 class="underline-header">Large scale water savings:</h3>

            <p>When trialled by Elmbridge Borough Council, they found that <em>"watering was required on the polymer
                    treated bed 7 times through the next 16 weeks whereas the untreated beds needed watering 52 times
                    over the same period. This represents a saving on watering costs in the order of 86.54%"</em>.</p>

            <p>In total, <em>"the Borough estimates that £330.00 worth of P4 provided a gross saving of £1,400.00"</em>.

            <h3 class="underline-header">Better stock quality:</h3>

            <p>From Nurseryman and Garden Centre Magazine: <em>"the addition of P4 means [you] can produce a better
                    quality, more mature plant, more consistently than before, in the same time"</em>.</p>

            <h3 class="underline-header">Gaining an edge on the competition:</h3>

            <p>One of our customers trialling P4 on container conifers came to the following conclusions:</p>

            <p>"It is therefore possible to say that the inclusion of Broadleaf P4 in commercial composts has:</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Reduced the frequency of water application by much more than 50%. This is a saving of labour and
                    water cost which would at least partially offset the additional cost of Broadleaf P4 and possibly
                    release staff for more profitable duties.
                </li>
                <li>Reduced the amount of fertiliser leaching and/or made more efficient use of the fertiliser applied,
                    indicating the possibility for reducing fertilizer application rates.
                </li>
                <li>Produced a plant reaching earlier market readiness. The shorter production time could also enable an
                    extra crop during a given time period, further improving the earnings potential of the production
                    area".

                clean and easy to give and extraordinarily inexpensive; we also have the extra assurance that our trees
