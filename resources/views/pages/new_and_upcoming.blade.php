            <p>We have BROADLEAF PROPAGATING POLYMER available. This polymer is a slightly smaller size than our regular
                Broadleaf P4 and is ideal for use in smaller modules and propagating systems.</p>

            <p>Please <a href="#">contact us</a> if you would be interested in this product and we will discuss your
                requirements. It is now available in 2, 10 and 25kg packs, and is the same price as the rest of our
                range.</p>

            <h2>NOW IN STOCK</h2>

            <p>We are now offering Broadleaf Root Dip and Broadleaf P4 in 250g containers as well as our traditional
                2kg, 10kg and 25kg packs. These smaller packs are perfect for the casual or hobby gardener, this allows
                you to benefit from the superb performance of our Broadleaf products without having to buy at trade
                quantities.</p>

            <p>A 250g tub of regular P4 will treat a quarter of a ton of soil/compost, while the same size tub of root
                dip will treat around 325 45-60 cm transplants (perfect for vegetables, bedding colour plants or any
                other situation where plant roots are liable to drying out).</p>
