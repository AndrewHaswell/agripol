            <div class="light-banner">Product Feedback</div>
            <p>write-ups from magazines and papers, customer trials and results that are too lengthy and detailed to be on the 'Customer Feedback' page.</p>

            <p>Scientific papers looking at our polymers and their applications.  (There is also a series of 10 scientific papers relevant to different uses of P4- however, these are too large to include in the library.  If you would like a copy of these as a .zip file, please email <a href="support@agripol.co.uk">support@agripol.co.uk</a> and we will send them.)</p>

            <div class="medium-banner">(Please note- some of the contact details and addresses on documents in the Library are out of date- please always use our 'Contact Us' page for up-to-date contact details.)</div>
