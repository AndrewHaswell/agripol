                <h1>Broadleaf P4 - Water Storing Granules</h1>
            </div>

            <h3>Broadleaf P4 can reduce your watering by approximately 75%</h3>

            <p>In addition, it provides improved soil structure and better plant and root growth. It also reduces
                leaching and
                fertiliser wastage.</p>

            <p>P4 lasts in the soil for years, giving improved plant growth season after season, before eventually
                breaking down
                into non-harmful substances.</p>

            <p>'P4' is a safe, man-made, granular soil and compost additive which can absorb hundreds of times it's own
                weight
                of water. When incorporated into growing or planting media, the polymer granules store rain or
                irrigation water
                right where it's needed - at the roots.</p>

            <p>Plant roots colonise the millions of tiny reservoirs of water-charged polymer gel and can extract over
                95% of the
                stored water as required, over an extended period of time.</p>

            <p>P4 can repeatedly absorb, store and release water direct to the plant roots for 5 years or more and has
                been
                shown to be beneficial for all plant varieties at all growth stages (and in all growing media).</p>

            <p>Below are just a few images demonstrating what P4 can do for your plants- for trial results and magazine
                articles
                please check our 'Technical Library'. Alternatively, if you want to know something specific or would

                <h3>How P4 Absorbs Water</h3>

                <p>P4 is stored and transported as small, non-hazardous crystals. Once these are mixed into your
                    compost/growing media and hydrated, they begin absorbing water and swelling. Once they are fully
                    hydrated, they resemble jelly particles. Plant roots colonise these particles, which release the
                    water back to the plant as the plant needs it.</p>

                <h3>Adding P4 to Compost</h3>

                <p>Adding P4 to compost allows plants to grow faster and better than planting/seeding in non-treated
                    compost. From a few flowers or veggies in the back garden to huge landscaping projects, P4
                    consistently provides increased growth compared to non-treated plants.</p>

                <h3>Speedier Maturation</h3>

                <p>It's not only increased growth, but faster maturation that makes P4 ideal for landscaping and hobby
                    gardening. Plants flower earlier and for longer, as they have minimal water stress to slow their
                    growth. In this picture, P4 treated plants are in the centre column, with non-treated plants on
                    either side.</p>

                <h3>Plant Survival</h3>

                <p>These trays of Barley, grown under controlled drought conditions, show how the addition of P4
                    improves plant survival. The plants were not watered for the six days previous to this photograph,
                    and you can see the P4 treated plants show no sign of water stress. The P4 treated Barley then
                    matured to harvest stage with no additional water or nutrient supply.</p>
