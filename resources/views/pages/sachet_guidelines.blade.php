            <p>If you have received a sample sachet of Broadleaf P4 through one of our promotions, but are not sure what
                to do with it, we have provided a step by step guide for how to get the best results.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Your 10g sachet will treat ~10L of compost</li>
                <li>Put your compost into a bucket and sprinkle the sachet on top.</li>
                <li>Make sure your hands are dry and mix the P4 into the compost so it is evenly spead.</li>
                <li>Put your compost/P4 mix into whatever you are planting into (hanging basket, propagating trays,
                    etc., but do not plant anything yet.
                </li>
                <li>Leave a gap at the top- P4 swells up, so you do not want it to overflow!</li>
                <li>Water the compost to capacity and leave for an hour or so. Top up with more water, to make sure the
                    granules are fully hydrated.
                </li>
                <li>Plant your seeds/plants as normal.</li>
                <li>You can now safely relax- the need to water is usually reduced by around 75%, so once or twice a
                    week is often sufficient.
                </li>
                <li>Keep an eye on your plants and water whenever they show signs of wilting.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>A handy tip:</strong> If you are planting seeds, hydrate a few granules of P4 first. Push your
                seed a little way into the top of a granule, then place in the soil and cover over lightly. This will
                ensure the seedling has an ample supply of water as it's germinating and starting to put out roots,
                which will mean you are far less likely to lose it to drought/stress, and your plant has the best
                possible chance of growing up big and healthy!</p>
