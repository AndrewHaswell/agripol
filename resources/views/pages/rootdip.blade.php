            <p>Broadleaf Root Dip is beneficial for all sizes of softwood and hardwood trees and on all species of
                bushes and shrubs. It is also ideal for bare-root transplanting of vegetable crops and international
                transporting of bare-root plant material.</p>

            <h3>USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH BROADLEAF P4 FOR LONG TERM BENEFITS</h3>

            <p>It should be noted that bare-root dipping is intended to act only as an anti-desiccant to extend
                out-of-soil life and counteract transplant shock. It is not designed to replace the incorporation of
                Broadleaf P4 into tree-planting pockets, which will still be needed to supply roots with adequate
                moisture to support a sizeable leaf canopy over an extended period of time after transplanting.</p>

            <p>Bare-root treatment with BROADLEAF ROOT DIP and planting-pocket incorporation of Broadleaf P4 can be used
                together in a complementary manner to great short and long term benefit.</p>

            <h3 class="underline-header">How Much Broadleaf Root Dip will be needed to treat a given quantity of
                bare-root stock?</h3>

            <p>The amount of gel that can be loaded onto the bare roots will depend on the type of root system (e.g.
                fibrous & bushy or spindly) and the consistency of the gel.</p>

            <p>The following table shows the average quantity of bare-root stock that can be dipped with 1 Kg of powder,
                hydrated in average quality water. Please use for guidance only.</p>
